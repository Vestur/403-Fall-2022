This course covers concepts and methods to understand how robots move and interact with the physical world. We will study how to define robots, describe their state, and control their motion. We will study the representation of three-dimensional movement, mechanisms (kinematics and dynamics), actuators, dynamics-based feedback control, and trajectory optimization. Students will also learn Matlab software to build simulation and analysis tools. Prerequisites: MATH 235 and COMPSCI 220 (or COMPSCI 230). 3 credits.
